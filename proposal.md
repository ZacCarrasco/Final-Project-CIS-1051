# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pointless Wingdings Translater

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

The use of my project is to take the font in word called "wingdings" and have the code imput a file transfer it all to wingdigs and then output a new file. There is no point to this other than it is a good joke for when you want to quickly transfer anything wingdings.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The code for my project will read an file in a folder. After it reads a file in the folder it will then take it in and publish it again in another outputed file but the words will be translated into wingdings.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for the project is that it at least is able to translate english to wingdings. Just like if you changed the font in word.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The better outcome would be it exported it as a whole different document.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

the best outcome is listed above

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Looking more into and reading file reading codes.
